Welcome to 𝕊𝕜𝕖𝕝𝕝𝕪 𝔾𝕒𝕞𝕚𝕟𝕘💀™
Here, we provide the best of the best experience in gaming & unblocking. We know that you may be desperate, in search of something unblockable, well, you have us!
Unblock your school computer & browse privately with our lightspeed killing proxy!


If you want to make one, I will provide the steps below here,



Step one: fork this very repository, (if you haven't then do it, please)
Step two: click on "code", then click on "create new workspace" if you haven't. If you have, please click on your existing one.
Step three: where it says "terminal", down below that, type "npm install"
Step four: Then type, "npm run start"
Step five: then click "make public" when it shows a localhost port popup down below.
Step six: Click on ports. (Next to terminal).
Step seven: click on the web button.

You're done!

Share this with your friends. But you may only know that the forwarded port only lasts from a time range 30min - 240min. As long as you're online with that repository and npm codespace and the website open with your device open, you're good.
